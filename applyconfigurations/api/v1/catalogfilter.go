	// packageName specifies the name of the package to be installed and is used to filter

	PackageName *string `json:"packageName,omitempty"`
	// version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions).
	// When unspecified, the latest version available is installed.
	//
	// Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.
	// Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or more comparison operators,
	// known as comparison strings.
	// You can add additional comparison strings using the OR operator (||).
	//
	// # Range Comparisons
	//
	// To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,
	// <3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that
	// range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than
	// or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any
	// upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,
	// those upgrades should be automatically performed.
	//
	// # Pinned Versions
	//
	// To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that
	// "pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no
	// automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is
	// "0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never
	// upgrade from this version".
	//
	// # Basic Comparison Operators
	//
	// The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:
	// - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)
	// - "!=", not equal
	// - "<", less than
	// - ">", greater than
	// - ">=", greater than OR equal to
	// - "<=", less than OR equal to
	//
	// # Wildcard Comparisons
	//
	// You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all
	// comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:
	// - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"
	// - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"
	// - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"
	// - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"
	//
	// # Patch Release Comparisons
	//
	// When you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you
	// can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:
	// - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"
	// - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"
	// - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"
	// - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"
	//
	// # Major Release Comparisons
	//
	// You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a
	// stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:
	// - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
	// - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
	// - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"
	// - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"
	// - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"
	// - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"
	// - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"
	// - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"
	// - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"
	//
	// # OR Comparisons
	// You can use the "||" character to represent an OR operation in the version
	// range. Some examples:
	// - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 || >3.0.0"
	// - "^0 || ^3 || ^5"
	//
	// For more information on semver, please see https://semver.org/
	Version *string `json:"version,omitempty"`
	// channels is optional and specifies a set of channels belonging to the package
	// specified in the packageName field.
	//
	// A channel is a package-author-defined stream of updates for an extension.
	//
	// Each channel in the list must follow the DNS subdomain standard as defined in [RFC 1123].
	// It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-) or periods (.),
	// start and end with an alphanumeric character, and be no longer than 253 characters.
	// You can specify no more than 256 channels.
	//
	// When specified, it constrains the set of installable bundles and the automated upgrade path.
	// This constraint is an AND operation with the version field. For example:
	// - Given channel is set to "foo"
	// - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"
	// - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison are considered installable
	// - Automatic upgrades are constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel
	//
	// When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels are used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.
	//
	// Some examples of valid values are:
	// - 1.1.x
	// - alpha
	// - stable
	// - stable-v1
	// - v1-stable
	// - dev-preview
	// - preview
	// - community
	//
	// Some examples of invalid values are:
	// - -some-channel
	// - some-channel-
	// - thisisareallylongchannelnamethatisgreaterthanthemaximumlength
	// - original_40
	// - --default-channel

	// selector is optional and filters the set of ClusterCatalogs used in the bundle selection process.

	// upgradeConstraintPolicy is optional and controls whether the upgrade paths defined in the catalog
	// are enforced for the package referenced in the packageName field.
	//
	// Allowed values are "CatalogProvided", "SelfCertified", or omitted.
	//
	// When set to "CatalogProvided", automatic upgrades only occur when upgrade constraints specified by the package
	// author are met.
	//
	// When set to "SelfCertified", the upgrade constraints specified by the package author are ignored.
	// This allows upgrades and downgrades to any version of the package.
	// This is considered a dangerous operation as it can lead to unknown and potentially disastrous outcomes,
	// such as data loss.
	// Use this option only if you have independently verified the changes.
	//
	// When omitted, the default value is "CatalogProvided".
