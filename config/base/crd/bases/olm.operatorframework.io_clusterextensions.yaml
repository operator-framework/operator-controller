                  for the ClusterExtension such as the installation namespace,
                  the service account and the pre-flight check configuration.

                  Below is a minimal example of an installation definition (in yaml):

                      content for the package referenced in the packageName field will be applied.
                      The bundle may contain cluster-scoped resources or resources that are
                      applied to other Namespaces. This Namespace is expected to exist.

                      namespace is required, immutable, and follows the DNS label standard

                  Catalog is currently the only implemented sourceType, and setting the

                          A "channel" is a package author defined stream of updates for an extension.

                          When specified, it is used to constrain the set of installable bundles and
                          the automated upgrade path. This constraint is an AND operation with the
                          version field. For example:
                            - Given channel is set to "foo"
                            - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"
                            - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison will be considered installable
                            - Automatic upgrades will be constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel

                          When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels will be used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.

                          upgradeConstraintPolicy is an optional field that controls whether
                          the upgrade path(s) defined in the catalog are enforced for the package
                          referenced in the packageName field.

                          Allowed values are: ["CatalogProvided", "SelfCertified"].

                          When this field is set to "CatalogProvided", automatic upgrades will only occur
                          when upgrade constraints specified by the package author are met.

                          When this field is set to "SelfCertified", the upgrade constraints specified by
                          the package author are ignored. This allows for upgrades and downgrades to
                          any version of the package. This is considered a dangerous operation as it
                          can lead to unknown and potentially disastrous outcomes, such as data
                          loss. It is assumed that users have independently verified changes when
                          using this option.

                          If unspecified, the default value is "CatalogProvided".

                        description: |-
                          version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.

                          Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.
                          Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or
                          more comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional
                          comparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).

                          # Range Comparisons

                          To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,
                          <3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that
                          range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than
                          or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any
                          upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,
                          those upgrades should be automatically performed.

                          # Pinned Versions

                          To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that
                          "pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no
                          automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is
                          "0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never
                          upgrade from this version".

                          # Basic Comparison Operators

                          The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:
                            - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)
                            - "!=", not equal
                            - "<", less than
                            - ">", greater than
                            - ">=", greater than OR equal to
                            - "<=", less than OR equal to

                          # Wildcard Comparisons

                          You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all
                          comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:
                            - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"
                            - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"
                            - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"
                            - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"

                          # Patch Release Comparisons

                          When you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you
                          can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:
                            - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"
                            - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"
                            - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"
                            - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"

                          # Major Release Comparisons

                          You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a
                          stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:
                            - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
                            - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
                            - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"
                            - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"
                            - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"
                            - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"
                            - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"
                            - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"
                            - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"

                          # OR Comparisons
                          You can use the "||" character to represent an OR operation in the version
                          range. Some examples:
                            - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 || >3.0.0"
                            - "^0 || ^3 || ^5"

                    - "Succeeded", this reason is set on the "Installed" and "Progressing" conditions when initial installation and progressing to a new state is successful
                    - "Failed", this reason is set on the "Installed" condition when an error has occurred while performing the initial installation.
                    - "Blocked", this reason is set on the "Progressing" condition when the ClusterExtension controller has encountered an error that requires manual intervention for recovery
                    - "Retrying", this reason is set on the "Progressing" condition when the ClusterExtension controller has encountered an error that could be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts
                    - "Deprecated", this reason is set on the "Deprecated", "PackageDeprecated", "ChannelDeprecated", and "BundleDeprecated" conditions to signal that the installed package has been deprecated at the particular scope
