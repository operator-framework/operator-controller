        "description": "### Optimized for cloud and containers\nJBoss EAP 7 is built to provide simplified deployment and full Java™ EE performance for applications in any environment. Whether on-premise or in virtual, private, public, and hybrid clouds, JBoss EAP features a modular architecture that starts services only as they are required. The extreme low memory footprint and fast startup times mean that JBoss EAP is ideal for environments where efficient resource utilization is a priority, such as Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n### Lightweight, flexible architecture\nJBoss EAP 7 is built for high performance and maximum flexibility in modern application environments. Its extremely modular architecture and services-driven set of components reduces scale-out times and provides flexibility for applications deployed in different environments. Well-suited for microservices and traditional applications, JBoss EAP offers the flexibility to build the applications your business requires—from traditional to new web-scale, microservices applications.\n\n### More productive developers\nJBoss EAP allows developers to be more productive and responsive to line-of-business demands. Support for Java EE and a wide range of Java EE web-based frameworks, such as Spring, Spring Web Flow, Spring WS, Spring Security, Arquillian, AngularJS, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and Google Web Toolkit (GWT) comes standard. Use JBoss EAP with common DevOps tools to maximize productivity, decrease quality issues, and get new apps out to market faster.\n\n### Flexible management, configuration, and administration\nJBoss EAP 7 maximizes administrative productivity by making it easy to maintain and update your deployments. JBoss EAP 7 features an updated management console user interface with intuitive navigation and support for large-scale domain configurations. The updated command-line interface provides a quick, unified view into configurations and subsystems, while offering the ability to manage servers offline. This can be used with popular configuration management tools, such as Ansible Tower by Red Hat or Puppet—making editing XML configuration files unnecessary.\n\n### Flexible, future-friendly subscription model\nA subscription to JBoss EAP provides you both technical and business flexibility. Eliminate upfront, binding licensing decisions that lock you into specific deployment environments, hardware machines, infrastructure, or levels of enterprise support. With a Red Hat subscription, you’re free to build your application and then decide where and how you’ll deploy.\n",

Whether on-premise or in virtual, private, public, and hybrid clouds, JBoss EAP features a modular architecture that starts services only as they are required. The extreme low memory footprint and fast startup times mean that JBoss EAP is ideal for environments where efficient resource utilization is a priority, such as Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n### Lightweight, flexible architecture\nJBoss EAP 7 is built for high performance and maximum flexibility in modern application environments. Its extremely modular architecture and services-driven set of components reduces scale-out times and provides flexibility for applications deployed in different environments. Well-suited for microservices and traditional applications, JBoss EAP offers the flexibility to build the applications your business requires—from traditional to new web-scale, microservices applications.\n\n### More productive developers\nJBoss EAP allows developers to be more productive and responsive to line-of-business demands. Support for Java EE and a wide range of Java EE web-based frameworks, such as Spring, Spring Web Flow, Spring WS, Spring Security, Arquillian, AngularJS, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and Google Web Toolkit (GWT) comes standard. Use JBoss EAP with common DevOps tools to maximize productivity, decrease quality issues, and get new apps out to market faster.\n\n### Flexible management, configuration, and administration\nJBoss EAP 7 maximizes administrative productivity by making it easy to maintain and update your deployments. JBoss EAP 7 features an updated management console user interface with intuitive navigation and support for large-scale domain configurations. The updated command-line interface provides a quick, unified view into configurations and subsystems, while offering the ability to manage servers offline. This can be used with popular configuration management tools, such as Ansible Tower by Red Hat or Puppet—making editing XML configuration files unnecessary.\n\n### Flexible, future-friendly subscription model\nA subscription to JBoss EAP provides you both technical and business flexibility. Eliminate upfront, binding licensing decisions that lock you into specific deployment environments, hardware machines, infrastructure, or levels of enterprise support. With a Red Hat subscription, you’re free to build your application and then decide where and how you’ll deploy.\n",

Some features of JBoss EAP are:\n\n**Optimized for cloud and containers**: with simplified deployment and full Jakarta EE performance for applications in any environment.\n\n**Lightweight, flexible architecture**: which is well-suited for microservices and traditional applications.\n\n**Support and standardize microservices development**: With the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform expansion pack that supports Eclipse MicroProfile application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator\nOperators are software components that extend the Kubernetes API to customize how to manage applications and their components.\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator facilitates the deployment and management of JBoss EAP on container orchestration platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift. The operator acts as an automated management tool, simplifying the process of provisioning, scaling, and updating JBoss EAP applications.\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator capabilities\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys and manages multiple instances of the JBoss EAP Java application in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. \n\n**Simplifies management**: Creates, configures, manages, and seamlessly upgrades instances of complex stateful applications. No more manual configuration, making management a breeze.\n\n**Efficient scaling**: Effortlessly scales the instances of your JBoss EAP Java application based on demand.\n\n**Faster updates**: Seamlessly updates, enabling you to roll out new operator features and bug fixes without downtime\n\n**Safe transaction recovery**: Provides safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination.\n\n# Operator installation and configuration\nLet's walk through the steps to install the JBoss EAP Operator on your OpenShift Cluster and deploy your first example application:\n\n**Step 1: Install JBoss EAP from OperatorHub**\n1. Click Install in the JBoss EAP operator window.\n2. In the Install Operator window, for Installation mode, select All namespaces on the cluster The operator is available in openshift-operators namespace.\n\n**Step 2: Build an application image**\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys an application image. If you do not have your JBoss EAP application image built yet, you can use the following example to build the image using Helm Charts.\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Helm Chart.\n3. Search for \"JBoss EAP 8\" (Provided by Red Hat) and create a new Helm Chart release.\n4. On the Release name text box, type “eap-application”. \n5. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    build:\n      uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap8-getting-started\n    deploy:\n      enabled: false\n    ```\n\n6. Click Create to build the application image.\n\n    The application image is created with the name eap-application:latest.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy your application with JBoss EAP Operator**\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Operator Backed > WildFlyServer > Create.\n3. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1\n    kind: WildFlyServer\n    metadata:\n      name: eap-application\n    spec:\n      applicationImage: eap-application:latest\n      replicas: 1\n    ```\n\n 4.

Some features of JBoss EAP are:\n\n**Optimized for cloud and containers**: with simplified deployment and full Jakarta EE performance for applications in any environment.\n\n**Lightweight, flexible architecture**: which is well-suited for microservices and traditional applications.\n\n**Support and standardize microservices development**: With the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform expansion pack that supports Eclipse MicroProfile application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator\nOperators are software components that extend the Kubernetes API to customize how to manage applications and their components.\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator facilitates the deployment and management of JBoss EAP on container orchestration platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift. The operator acts as an automated management tool, simplifying the process of provisioning, scaling, and updating JBoss EAP applications.\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator capabilities\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys and manages multiple instances of the JBoss EAP Java application in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. \n\n**Simplifies management**: Creates, configures, manages, and seamlessly upgrades instances of complex stateful applications. No more manual configuration, making management a breeze.\n\n**Efficient scaling**: Effortlessly scales the instances of your JBoss EAP Java application based on demand.\n\n**Faster updates**: Seamlessly updates, enabling you to roll out new operator features and bug fixes without downtime\n\n**Safe transaction recovery**: Provides safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination.\n\n# Operator installation and configuration\nLet's walk through the steps to install the JBoss EAP Operator on your OpenShift Cluster and deploy your first example application:\n\n**Step 1: Install JBoss EAP from OperatorHub**\n1. Click Install in the JBoss EAP operator window.\n2. In the Install Operator window, for Installation mode, select All namespaces on the cluster The operator is available in openshift-operators namespace.\n\n**Step 2: Build an application image**\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys an application image. If you do not have your JBoss EAP application image built yet, you can use the following example to build the image using Helm Charts.\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Helm Chart.\n3. Search for \"JBoss EAP 8\" (Provided by Red Hat) and create a new Helm Chart release.\n4. On the Release name text box, type “eap-application”. \n5. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    build:\n      uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap8-getting-started\n    deploy:\n      enabled: false\n    ```\n\n6. Click Create to build the application image.\n\n    The application image is created with the name eap-application:latest.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy your application with JBoss EAP Operator**\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Operator Backed > WildFlyServer > Create.\n3. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1\n    kind: WildFlyServer\n    metadata:\n      name: eap-application\n    spec:\n      applicationImage: eap-application:latest\n      replicas: 1\n    ```\n\n 4.

Some features of JBoss EAP are:\n\n**Optimized for cloud and containers**: with simplified deployment and full Jakarta EE performance for applications in any environment.\n\n**Lightweight, flexible architecture**: which is well-suited for microservices and traditional applications.\n\n**Support and standardize microservices development**: With the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform expansion pack that supports Eclipse MicroProfile application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator\nOperators are software components that extend the Kubernetes API to customize how to manage applications and their components.\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator facilitates the deployment and management of JBoss EAP on container orchestration platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift. The operator acts as an automated management tool, simplifying the process of provisioning, scaling, and updating JBoss EAP applications.\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator capabilities\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys and manages multiple instances of the JBoss EAP Java application in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. \n\n**Simplifies management**: Creates, configures, manages, and seamlessly upgrades instances of complex stateful applications. No more manual configuration, making management a breeze.\n\n**Efficient scaling**: Effortlessly scales the instances of your JBoss EAP Java application based on demand.\n\n**Faster updates**: Seamlessly updates, enabling you to roll out new operator features and bug fixes without downtime\n\n**Safe transaction recovery**: Provides safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination.\n\n# Operator installation and configuration\nLet's walk through the steps to install the JBoss EAP Operator on your OpenShift Cluster and deploy your first example application:\n\n**Step 1: Install JBoss EAP from OperatorHub**\n1. Click Install in the JBoss EAP operator window.\n2. In the Install Operator window, for Installation mode, select All namespaces on the cluster The operator is available in openshift-operators namespace.\n\n**Step 2: Build an application image**\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys an application image. If you do not have your JBoss EAP application image built yet, you can use the following example to build the image using Helm Charts.\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Helm Chart.\n3. Search for \"JBoss EAP 8\" (Provided by Red Hat) and create a new Helm Chart release.\n4. On the Release name text box, type “eap-application”. \n5. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    build:\n      uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap8-getting-started\n    deploy:\n      enabled: false\n    ```\n\n6. Click Create to build the application image.\n\n    The application image is created with the name eap-application:latest.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy your application with JBoss EAP Operator**\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Operator Backed > WildFlyServer > Create.\n3. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1\n    kind: WildFlyServer\n    metadata:\n      name: eap-application\n    spec:\n      applicationImage: eap-application:latest\n      replicas: 1\n    ```\n\n 4. Click Create to deploy the application with JBoss EAP Operator.\n",

Some features of JBoss EAP are:\n\n**Optimized for cloud and containers**: with simplified deployment and full Jakarta EE performance for applications in any environment.\n\n**Lightweight, flexible architecture**: which is well-suited for microservices and traditional applications.\n\n**Support and standardize microservices development**: With the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform expansion pack that supports Eclipse MicroProfile application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator\nOperators are software components that extend the Kubernetes API to customize how to manage applications and their components.\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator facilitates the deployment and management of JBoss EAP on container orchestration platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift. The operator acts as an automated management tool, simplifying the process of provisioning, scaling, and updating JBoss EAP applications.\n\n# JBoss EAP Operator capabilities\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys and manages multiple instances of the JBoss EAP Java application in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. \n\n**Simplifies management**: Creates, configures, manages, and seamlessly upgrades instances of complex stateful applications. No more manual configuration, making management a breeze.\n\n**Efficient scaling**: Effortlessly scales the instances of your JBoss EAP Java application based on demand.\n\n**Faster updates**: Seamlessly updates, enabling you to roll out new operator features and bug fixes without downtime\n\n**Safe transaction recovery**: Provides safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination.\n\n# Operator installation and configuration\nLet's walk through the steps to install the JBoss EAP Operator on your OpenShift Cluster and deploy your first example application:\n\n**Step 1: Install JBoss EAP from OperatorHub**\n1. Click Install in the JBoss EAP operator window.\n2. In the Install Operator window, for Installation mode, select All namespaces on the cluster The operator is available in openshift-operators namespace.\n\n**Step 2: Build an application image**\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys an application image. If you do not have your JBoss EAP application image built yet, you can use the following example to build the image using Helm Charts.\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Helm Chart.\n3. Search for \"JBoss EAP 8\" (Provided by Red Hat) and create a new Helm Chart release.\n4. On the Release name text box, type “eap-application”. \n5. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    build:\n      uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap8-getting-started\n    deploy:\n      enabled: false\n    ```\n\n6. Click Create to build the application image.\n\n    The application image is created with the name eap-application:latest.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy your application with JBoss EAP Operator**\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Operator Backed > WildFlyServer > Create.\n3. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1\n    kind: WildFlyServer\n    metadata:\n      name: eap-application\n    spec:\n      applicationImage: eap-application:latest\n      replicas: 1\n    ```\n\n 4. Click Create to deploy the application with JBoss EAP Operator.\n",

No more manual configuration, making management a breeze.\n\n**Efficient scaling**: Effortlessly scales the instances of your JBoss EAP Java application based on demand.\n\n**Faster updates**: Seamlessly updates, enabling you to roll out new operator features and bug fixes without downtime\n\n**Safe transaction recovery**: Provides safe transaction recovery in your application cluster by verifying all transactions are completed before scaling down the replicas and marking a pod as clean for termination.\n\n# Operator installation and configuration\nLet's walk through the steps to install the JBoss EAP Operator on your OpenShift Cluster and deploy your first example application:\n\n**Step 1: Install JBoss EAP from OperatorHub**\n1. Click Install in the JBoss EAP operator window.\n2. In the Install Operator window, for Installation mode, select All namespaces on the cluster The operator is available in openshift-operators namespace.\n\n**Step 2: Build an application image**\n\nThe JBoss EAP Operator deploys an application image. If you do not have your JBoss EAP application image built yet, you can use the following example to build the image using Helm Charts.\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Helm Chart.\n3. Search for \"JBoss EAP 8\" (Provided by Red Hat) and create a new Helm Chart release.\n4. On the Release name text box, type “eap-application”. \n5. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    build:\n      uri: https://github.com/jboss-eap-up-and-running/eap8-getting-started\n    deploy:\n      enabled: false\n    ```\n\n6. Click Create to build the application image.\n\n    The application image is created with the name eap-application:latest.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy your application with JBoss EAP Operator**\n\n1. In the main navigation, click the dropdown menu (perspective switcher) and select Developer.\n2. Click Add > Operator Backed > WildFlyServer > Create.\n3. Switch to the YAML view and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n    ```\n    apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1\n    kind: WildFlyServer\n    metadata:\n      name: eap-application\n    spec:\n      applicationImage: eap-application:latest\n      replicas: 1\n    ```\n\n 4. Click Create to deploy the application with JBoss EAP Operator.\n",
