            properties:
              availabilityMode:
                default: Available
                description: |-
                  availabilityMode allows users to define how the ClusterCatalog is made available to clients on the cluster.
                  availabilityMode is optional.

                  Allowed values are "Available" and "Unavailable" and omitted.

                  When omitted, the default value is "Available".

                  When set to "Available", the catalog contents will be unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.
                  Setting the availabilityMode to "Available" tells clients that they should consider this ClusterCatalog
                  and its contents as usable.

                  When set to "Unavailable", the catalog contents will no longer be served over the catalog content HTTP server.
                  When set to this availabilityMode it should be interpreted the same as the ClusterCatalog not existing.
                  Setting the availabilityMode to "Unavailable" can be useful in scenarios where a user may not want
                  to delete the ClusterCatalog all together, but would still like it to be treated as if it doesn't exist.
                enum:
                - Unavailable
                - Available

                  priority allows the user to define a priority for a ClusterCatalog.
                  priority is optional.

                  A ClusterCatalog's priority is used by clients as a tie-breaker between ClusterCatalogs that meet the client's requirements.
                  A higher number means higher priority.

                  It is up to clients to decide how to handle scenarios where multiple ClusterCatalogs with the same priority meet their requirements.
                  When deciding how to break the tie in this scenario, it is recommended that clients prompt their users for additional input.

                  When omitted, the default priority is 0 because that is the zero value of integers.

                  Negative numbers can be used to specify a priority lower than the default.
                  Positive numbers can be used to specify a priority higher than the default.

                  The lowest possible value is -2147483648.
                  The highest possible value is 2147483647.

              source:
                description: |-
                  source allows a user to define the source of a catalog.
                  A "catalog" contains information on content that can be installed on a cluster.
                  Providing a catalog source makes the contents of the catalog discoverable and usable by
                  other on-cluster components.
                  These on-cluster components may do a variety of things with this information, such as
                  presenting the content in a GUI dashboard or installing content from the catalog on the cluster.
                  The catalog source must contain catalog metadata in the File-Based Catalog (FBC) format.
                  For more information on FBC, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/#docs.
                  source is a required field.

                  Below is a minimal example of a ClusterCatalogSpec that sources a catalog from an image:

                   source:
                     type: Image
                     image:
                       ref: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest
                properties:
                  image:
                    description: |-
                      image is used to configure how catalog contents are sourced from an OCI image.
                      This field is required when type is Image, and forbidden otherwise.
                    properties:
                      pollIntervalMinutes:
                        description: |-
                          pollIntervalMinutes allows the user to set the interval, in minutes, at which the image source should be polled for new content.
                          pollIntervalMinutes is optional.
                          pollIntervalMinutes can not be specified when ref is a digest-based reference.

                          When omitted, the image will not be polled for new content.
                        minimum: 1
                        type: integer
                      ref:
                        description: |-
                          ref allows users to define the reference to a container image containing Catalog contents.
                          ref is required.
                          ref can not be more than 1000 characters.

                          A reference can be broken down into 3 parts - the domain, name, and identifier.

                          The domain is typically the registry where an image is located.
                          It must be alphanumeric characters (lowercase and uppercase) separated by the "." character.
                          Hyphenation is allowed, but the domain must start and end with alphanumeric characters.
                          Specifying a port to use is also allowed by adding the ":" character followed by numeric values.
                          The port must be the last value in the domain.
                          Some examples of valid domain values are "registry.mydomain.io", "quay.io", "my-registry.io:8080".

                          The name is typically the repository in the registry where an image is located.
                          It must contain lowercase alphanumeric characters separated only by the ".", "_", "__", "-" characters.
                          Multiple names can be concatenated with the "/" character.
                          The domain and name are combined using the "/" character.
                          Some examples of valid name values are "operatorhubio/catalog", "catalog", "my-catalog.prod".
                          An example of the domain and name parts of a reference being combined is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog".

                          The identifier is typically the tag or digest for an image reference and is present at the end of the reference.
                          It starts with a separator character used to distinguish the end of the name and beginning of the identifier.
                          For a digest-based reference, the "@" character is the separator.
                          For a tag-based reference, the ":" character is the separator.
                          An identifier is required in the reference.

                          Digest-based references must contain an algorithm reference immediately after the "@" separator.
                          The algorithm reference must be followed by the ":" character and an encoded string.
                          The algorithm must start with an uppercase or lowercase alpha character followed by alphanumeric characters and may contain the "-", "_", "+", and "." characters.
                          Some examples of valid algorithm values are "sha256", "sha256+b64u", "multihash+base58".
                          The encoded string following the algorithm must be hex digits (a-f, A-F, 0-9) and must be a minimum of 32 characters.

                          Tag-based references must begin with a word character (alphanumeric + "_") followed by word characters or ".", and "-" characters.
                          The tag must not be longer than 127 characters.

                          An example of a valid digest-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog@sha256:200d4ddb2a73594b91358fe6397424e975205bfbe44614f5846033cad64b3f05"
                          An example of a valid tag-based image reference is "quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest"

                  The Serving condition is used to represent whether or not the contents of the catalog is being served via the HTTP(S) web server.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Available, the contents of the catalog are being served.

                  When it has a status of False and a reason of UserSpecifiedUnavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the catalog has been intentionally marked as unavailable.

                  The Progressing condition is used to represent whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing or is ready to progress towards a new state.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Retrying, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that may be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.
                  When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the ClusterCatalog has successfully progressed to a new state and is ready to continue progressing.
                  When it has a status of False and a reason of Blocked, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that requires manual intervention for recovery.

                  source is a required field which selects the installation source of content
                  for this ClusterExtension. Selection is performed by setting the sourceType.

                  Catalog is currently the only implemented sourceType, and setting the
                  sourcetype to "Catalog" requires the catalog field to also be defined.

                  Below is a minimal example of a source definition (in yaml):

                        description: |-
                          channels is an optional reference to a set of channels belonging to
                          the package specified in the packageName field.

                          A "channel" is a package-author-defined stream of updates for an extension.

                          Each channel in the list must follow the DNS subdomain standard
                          as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,
                          hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,
                          and be no longer than 253 characters. No more than 256 channels can be specified.

                          When specified, it is used to constrain the set of installable bundles and
                          the automated upgrade path. This constraint is an AND operation with the
                          version field. For example:
                            - Given channel is set to "foo"
                            - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"
                            - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison will be considered installable
                            - Automatic upgrades will be constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel

                          When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels will be used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.

                          version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.

                          Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.
                          Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or
                          more comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional
                          comparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).

                          # Range Comparisons

                          To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,
                          <3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that
                          range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than
                          or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any
                          upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,
                          those upgrades should be automatically performed.

                          # Pinned Versions

                          To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that
                          "pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no
                          automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is
                          "0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never
                          upgrade from this version".

                          # Basic Comparison Operators

                          The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:
                            - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)
                            - "!=", not equal
                            - "<", less than
                            - ">", greater than
                            - ">=", greater than OR equal to
                            - "<=", less than OR equal to

                          # Wildcard Comparisons

                          You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all
                          comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:
                            - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"
                            - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"
                            - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"
                            - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"

                          can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:
                            - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"
                            - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"
                            - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"
                            - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"

                          # Major Release Comparisons

                          You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a
                          stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:
                            - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
                            - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
                            - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"
                            - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"
                            - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"
                            - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"
                            - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"
                            - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"
                            - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"

                          # OR Comparisons
                          You can use the "||" character to represent an OR operation in the version
                          range. Some examples:
                            - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 || >3.0.0"
                            - "^0 || ^3 || ^5"

                  The set of condition types which apply to all spec.source variations are Installed and Progressing.

                  The Installed condition represents whether or not the bundle has been installed for this ClusterExtension.
                  When Installed is True and the Reason is Succeeded, the bundle has been successfully installed.
                  When Installed is False and the Reason is Failed, the bundle has failed to install.

                  The Progressing condition represents whether or not the ClusterExtension is advancing towards a new state.
                  When Progressing is True and the Reason is Succeeded, the ClusterExtension is making progress towards a new state.
                  When Progressing is True and the Reason is Retrying, the ClusterExtension has encountered an error that could be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.
                  When Progressing is False and the Reason is Blocked, the ClusterExtension has encountered an error that requires manual intervention for recovery.

                  When the ClusterExtension is sourced from a catalog, if may also communicate a deprecation condition.
                  These are indications from a package owner to guide users away from a particular package, channel, or bundle.
                  BundleDeprecated is set if the requested bundle version is marked deprecated in the catalog.
                  ChannelDeprecated is set if the requested channel is marked deprecated in the catalog.
                  PackageDeprecated is set if the requested package is marked deprecated in the catalog.
                  Deprecated is a rollup condition that is present when any of the deprecated conditions are present.
