// Unpacker unpacks catalog content, either synchronously or asynchronously and
// returns a Result, which conveys information about the progress of unpacking
// the catalog content.
//
// If a Source unpacks content asynchronously, it should register one or more
// watches with a controller to ensure that Bundles referencing this source
// can be reconciled as progress updates are available.
//
// For asynchronous Sources, multiple calls to Unpack should be made until the
// returned result includes state StateUnpacked.

// NOTE: A source is meant to be agnostic to specific catalog formats and
// specifications. A source should treat a catalog root directory as an opaque
// file tree and delegate catalog format concerns to catalog parsers.
