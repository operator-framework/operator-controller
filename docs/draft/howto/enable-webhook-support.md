## Installation of Bundles containing Webhooks

!!! note
This feature is still in *alpha*. Either the `WebhookProviderCertManager`, or the `WebhookProviderOpenshiftServiceCA`, feature-gate 
must be enabled to make use of it. See the instructions below on how to enable the feature-gate.

OLMv1 currently does not support the installation of bundles containing webhooks. The webhook support feature enables this capability.
Webhooks, or more concretely Admission Webhooks, are part of Kuberntes' [Dynamic Admission Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
feature. Webhooks run as services called by the kube-apiservice in due course of processing a resource related request. They can be used to validate resources, ensure reasonable default values,
are set, or aid in the migration to new CustomResourceDefinition schema. The communication with the webhook service is secured by TLS. In OLMv1, the TLS certificate is managed by a 
certificate provider. Currently, two certificate providers are supported: CertManager and Openshift-ServiceCA. The certificate provider to use given by the feature-gate:

- `WebhookProviderCertManager` for [CertManager](https://cert-manager.io/)
- `WebhookProviderOpenshiftServiceCA` for [Openshift-ServiceCA](https://github.com/openshift/service-ca-operator)

As CertManager is already installed with OLMv1, we suggest using `WebhookProviderCertManager`.

### Update OLM to enable Feature

```terminal title=Enable WebhookProviderCertManager feature
kubectl kustomize config/overlays/featuregate/webhook-provider-certmanager | kubectl apply -f -
```

Or,

```terminal title=Enable WebhookProviderOpenshiftServiceCA feature
kubectl kustomize config/overlays/featuregate/webhook-provider-openshift-serviceca | kubectl apply -f -
```

Then,

```terminal title=Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status -n olmv1-system deployment/operator-controller-controller-manager 
```

### Notes on the generated certificate

#### CertManager

The generated certificate maintains a high-level of parity with the certificate generated by OLMv0:
- Self-signed
- Two validity period, rotating 24h before expiry
- Valid for the webhook service's DNSNames:
  - <service-name>.<namespace>
  - <service-name>.<namespace>.svc
  - <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

#### Openshift-ServiceCA

Generation and rotation are completely governed by [Openshift-ServiceCA](https://github.com/openshift/service-ca-operator)

### How does it work?

There's no change in the installation flow. Just install a bundle containing webhooks as you would any other.

### Demo

!!! note
As there is no difference in usage or experience between the CertManager and Openshift-ServiceCA variants, only
the cert-manager variant is demoed.
