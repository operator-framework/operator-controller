OLM is an open-source [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) project with a friendly and supportive community of developers, testers,
 and documentation experts with a passion for Kubernetes.

Through the effort of redesigning OLM, the community also took the opportunity to make the project more accessible, 
and contributor-friendly through its weekly meetings, continuous planning, and a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/operator-framework/projects/8/)
 tracker that provides a convenient entry point to quickly find something interesting to work on and contribute.

You can reach out to the OLM community for feedbacks/discussions/contributions in the following channels:

* Kubernetes Slack channel: [#olm-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/olm-dev)
* [Operator Framework on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/operator-framework)
* Weekly in-person Working Group meeting: [olm-wg](https://github.com/operator-framework/community#operator-lifecycle-manager-working-group)
