#### CRDUpgradeSafetyPreflightConfig



CRDUpgradeSafetyPreflightConfig is the configuration for CRD upgrade safety preflight check.



_Appears in:_
- [PreflightConfig](#preflightconfig)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |

#### CatalogSource



CatalogSource defines the attributes used to identify and filter content from a catalog.



_Appears in:_
- [SourceConfig](#sourceconfig)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packageName` _string_ | packageName is a reference to the name of the package to be installed<br />and is used to filter the content from catalogs.<br /><br />packageName is required, immutable, and follows the DNS subdomain standard<br />as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,<br />hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,<br />and be no longer than 253 characters.<br /><br />Some examples of valid values are:<br />  - some-package<br />  - 123-package<br />  - 1-package-2<br />  - somepackage<br /><br />Some examples of invalid values are:<br />  - -some-package<br />  - some-package-<br />  - thisisareallylongpackagenamethatisgreaterthanthemaximumlength<br />  - some.package<br /><br />[RFC 1123]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |  | MaxLength: 253 <br />Required: \{\} <br /> |
| `version` _string_ | version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.<br /><br />Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.<br />Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or<br />more comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional<br />comparison strings can be added using the OR operator (\|\|).<br /><br /># Range Comparisons<br /><br />To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,<br /><3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that<br />range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than<br />or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any<br />upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,<br />those upgrades should be automatically performed.<br /><br /># Pinned Versions<br /><br />To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that<br />"pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no<br />automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is<br />"0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never<br />upgrade from this version".<br /><br /># Basic Comparison Operators<br /><br />The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:<br />  - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)<br />  - "!=", not equal<br />  - "<", less than<br />  - ">", greater than<br />  - ">=", greater than OR equal to<br />  - "<=", less than OR equal to<br /><br /># Wildcard Comparisons<br /><br />You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all<br />comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:<br />  - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"<br />  - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"<br />  - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"<br />  - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"<br /><br /># Patch Release Comparisons<br /><br />When you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you<br />can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:<br />  - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"<br />  - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"<br />  - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"<br />  - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"<br /><br /># Major Release Comparisons<br /><br />You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a<br />stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:<br />  - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"<br />  - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"<br />  - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"<br />  - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"<br />  - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"<br />  - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"<br />  - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"<br />  - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"<br />  - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"<br /><br /># OR Comparisons<br />You can use the "\|\|" character to represent an OR operation in the version<br />range. Some examples:<br />  - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 \|\| >3.0.0"<br />  - "^0 \|\| ^3 \|\| ^5"<br /><br />For more information on semver, please see https://semver.org/ |  | MaxLength: 64 <br /> |
| `channels` _string array_ | channels is an optional reference to a set of channels belonging to<br />the package specified in the packageName field.<br /><br />A "channel" is a package-author-defined stream of updates for an extension.<br /><br />Each channel in the list must follow the DNS subdomain standard<br />as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,<br />hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,<br />and be no longer than 253 characters. No more than 256 channels can be specified.<br /><br />When specified, it is used to constrain the set of installable bundles and<br />the automated upgrade path. This constraint is an AND operation with the<br />version field. For example:<br />  - Given channel is set to "foo"<br />  - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"<br />  - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison will be considered installable<br />  - Automatic upgrades will be constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel<br /><br />When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels will be used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.<br /><br />Some examples of valid values are:<br />  - 1.1.x<br />  - alpha<br />  - stable<br />  - stable-v1<br />  - v1-stable<br />  - dev-preview<br />  - preview<br />  - community<br /><br />Some examples of invalid values are:<br />  - -some-channel<br />  - some-channel-<br />  - thisisareallylongchannelnamethatisgreaterthanthemaximumlength<br />  - original_40<br />  - --default-channel<br /><br />[RFC 1123]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |  | MaxItems: 256 <br /> |

| `upgradeConstraintPolicy` _[UpgradeConstraintPolicy](#upgradeconstraintpolicy)_ | upgradeConstraintPolicy is an optional field that controls whether<br />the upgrade path(s) defined in the catalog are enforced for the package<br />referenced in the packageName field.<br /><br />Allowed values are: "CatalogProvided" or "SelfCertified", or omitted.<br /><br />When this field is set to "CatalogProvided", automatic upgrades will only occur<br />when upgrade constraints specified by the package author are met.<br /><br />When this field is set to "SelfCertified", the upgrade constraints specified by<br />the package author are ignored. This allows for upgrades and downgrades to<br />any version of the package. This is considered a dangerous operation as it<br />can lead to unknown and potentially disastrous outcomes, such as data<br />loss. It is assumed that users have independently verified changes when<br />using this option.<br /><br />When this field is omitted, the default value is "CatalogProvided". | CatalogProvided | Enum: [CatalogProvided SelfCertified] <br /> |
