# operator-controller
The operator-controller is the central component of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1.
It extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install extensions.

## Overview

OLM v1 is the follow-up to [OLM v0](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager). Its purpose is to provide APIs, 
controllers, and tooling that support the packaging, distribution, and lifecycling of Kubernetes extensions. It aims to:

- align with Kubernetes designs and user assumptions
- provide secure, high-quality, and predictable user experiences centered around declarative GitOps concepts
- give cluster admins the minimal necessary controls to build their desired cluster architectures and to have ultimate control

OLM v1 consists of two different components:

* operator-controller
* catalogd

For a more complete overview of OLM v1 and how it differs from OLM v0, see our [overview](docs/project/olmv1_design_decisions.md).

## Documentation

### ClusterCatalog Quickstart Steps

Procedure steps marked with an asterisk (`*`) are likely to change with future API updates.

**NOTE:** The examples below use the `-k` flag in curl to skip validating the TLS certificates. This is for demonstration purposes only.

1. To get started with OLM v1, please see our [Getting Started](https://operator-framework.github.io/operator-controller/getting-started/olmv1_getting_started/) documentation.

1. Create a `ClusterCatalog` object that points to the OperatorHub Community catalog by running the following command:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f - << EOF
    apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
    kind: ClusterCatalog
    metadata:
      name: operatorhubio
    spec:
      source:
        type: Image
        image:
          ref: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest
    EOF
    ```

1. Verify the `ClusterCatalog` object was created successfully by running the following command:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl describe clustercatalog/operatorhubio
    ```

   *Example output*
    ```sh
    Name:         operatorhubio
    Namespace:

      Urls:
        Base:  https://catalogd-service.olmv1-system.svc/catalogs/operatorhubio
    Events:    <none>
   ```

1. Port forward the `catalogd-service` service in the `olmv1-system` namespace:
    ```sh
    $ kubectl -n olmv1-system port-forward svc/catalogd-service 8080:443
    ```

1. Access the `v1/all` service endpoint and filter the results to a list of packages by running the following command:

    ```sh
    $ curl https://localhost:8080/catalogs/operatorhubio/api/v1/all | jq -s '.[] | select(.schema == "olm.package") | .name'
    ```

   *Example output*
    ```sh
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                    Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
